## [Tooling Setup](#tooling-setup)

**Peter Kim discusses a selection of tools** in "The Hacker Playbook" that he uses regularly. I've included them in this section as they have been found to be very useful. 

**SecLists is a collection of multiple types of lists** used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, and many more.

**Install the particular VirtualBox Extension Pack** on to the host:

## [Process](#process-and-practises)

**The fact that a WAF is in place** is often given away by simply inspecting the responses from the server side  
[https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/detecting-web-application-firewalls/](https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/detecting-web-application-firewalls/)

[http://cyberpedia.in/nmap-scripting-engine-scanning-in-kali-linux/](http://cyberpedia.in/nmap-scripting-engine-scanning-in-kali-linux/)

**NMap has a couple of good scripts out of the box** for WAF detection  
http-waf-detect: [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-detect.html](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-detect.html)  
http-waf-fingerprint: [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-fingerprint.html](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-fingerprint.html)

**WAFW00F is also an excellent tool**  
[https://github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f](https://github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f)

**nslookup** which generally provides less information and uses its own internal libraries as opposed to the OS resolver libraries that dig uses.  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93808/dig-vs-nslookup](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93808/dig-vs-nslookup)

**/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directories.jbrofuzz is not great**, but it is not bad either

**theHarvester** is a tool for gathering e-mail acconts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers)  
[https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)

**Docker used LXC** as the default execution environment before the release of version 0.9 on March 13, 2014  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)>)

**firejail**

**Allows a process and all its descendants** to have their own private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.  
[https://firejail.wordpress.com/](https://firejail.wordpress.com/)

**The source code is on github**

**Pre-built DEB, AUR and RPM packages** are available for download  
[https://firejail.wordpress.com/download-2/](https://firejail.wordpress.com/download-2/)

**Firejail can even run LXC, Docker and OpenVZ containers**  
[https://firejail.wordpress.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/](https://firejail.wordpress.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/)

**Qubes**

**Technically Qubes is not a Linux distribution**, it's closer to being a Xen distro if anything  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution)

**USB stacks and drivers are sand-boxed** in their own unprivileged VM (currently experimental)

**Along with security** as one of the primary goals of the GUI virtualisation subsystem, performance was also priority so the virtualised applications feel as if they were executed natively  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution)

**Based on monolithic kernels** usually containing tens of millions of lines of code. Most of this code is reachable from untrusted applications via all sorts of APIs, making the attack surface on the kernel huge.

**Other notable data-store compromises were LinkedIn** with 6.5 million user accounts compromised and 95% of the users passwords cracked in days. Why so fast? Because they used simple hashing, specifically SHA-1. Details provided [here](http://securitynirvana.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/final-word-on-linkedin-leak.html) on the findings.

**EBay with 145 million active buyers** had a small number of employee log-in credentials [compromised](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ebay-database-hacked-with-stolen-employee-credentials-/d/d-id/1269093) allowing unauthorised access to eBay's corporate network.

**The Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF)** also has a [plugin](https://github.com/owtf/owtf/wiki/Listing-Plugins) for testing captchas. While you are at it. Check out the [OWTF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_OWTF#tab=Main). It's a very useful tool for penetration testers and developers testing their own work. Focussed on making the process of penetration testing efficient with time. The main documentation is [here](http://docs.owtf.org/en/latest/).

**The function used to protect stored credentials** should balance attacker and defender verification. The defender needs an acceptable response time for verification of users’ credentials during peak use. However, the time required to map `<credential> -> <protected form>` must remain beyond threats’ hardware (GPU, FPGA) and technique (dictionary-based, brute force, etc) capabilities:
