**What you need to do** is be aware of how much productivity is killed with each switch. Then do everything in your power to make sure your Development Team is sheltered from as much as possible. [How to Increase Software Developer Productivity](http://blog.binarymist.net/2013/03/02/how-to-increase-software-developer-productivity/#context-switching) by Kim Carter.

**If the victim's SMTP server does not perform reverse [lookups on the hostname](http://www.social-engineer.org/framework/se-tools/computer-based/social-engineer-toolkit-set/)**, an email `from` and `reply-to` fields can be successfully spoofed.

**Other notable data-store compromises were LinkedIn** with 6.5 million user accounts compromised and 95% of the users passwords cracked in days. Why so fast?

**The function used to protect stored credentials** should balance attacker and defender verification. The defender needs an acceptable response time for verification of users’ credentials during peak use. However, the time required to map `<credential> -> <protected form>` must remain beyond threats’ hardware (GPU, FPGA) and technique (dictionary-based, brute force, etc) capabilities:
