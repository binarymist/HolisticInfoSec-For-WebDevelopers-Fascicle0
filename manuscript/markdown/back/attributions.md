**If the victim's SMTP server does not perform reverse [lookups on the hostname](http://www.social-engineer.org/framework/se-tools/computer-based/social-engineer-toolkit-set/)**, an email `from` and `reply-to` fields can be successfully spoofed.

**Doppelganger Domains** An old trick brought back to light by Peter Kim's [research](http://www.wired.com/2011/09/doppelganger-domains/) involving fortune 500 companies where they intercepted 20 GB of e-mail from miss typed addresses.  
Peter Kim discusses in "The Hacker PlayBook" about how he set-up SMTP and SSH doppelganger domains. This is an excellent book that I recommend reading.
