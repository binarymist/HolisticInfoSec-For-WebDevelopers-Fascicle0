* [MS Security Development Lifecycle](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/SDL/process/design.aspx) is actually pretty good.
* Although not specifically referred to in this model, the [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](https://www.bsimm.com/online/) resources are very helpful. They don't really tell you how to implement secure software, but they do provide scales to measure the maturity of your development processes on many dimensions.

[**Kali Linux package version tracking**](http://tools.kali.org/version-tracking) is useful for seeing what versions of tools are currently in the distribution.

## [People](#people)

**Morale, Productivity and Engagement Killers**: An excellent resource around motivation can be found in Chapter 11 of Steve McConnell's excellent "Rapid Development" book.

**Presentation I performed at AgileNZ 2014** around [increasing developer productivity](https://speakerdeck.com/binarymist/how-to-increase-software-developer-productivity)

[**Social Engineer**](http://www.social-engineer.org/) website has a plethora of excellent resources.

The following books have been influential for me and the content from the People chapter should reflect that. They are very insightful and well worth the investment.

* Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy
* The Art Of Deception by Kevin Mitnick
* Chapter 10 of Beyond Fear by Bruce Schneier
