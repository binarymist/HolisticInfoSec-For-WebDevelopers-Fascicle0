## 10,000' view and lower

Now that we've iterated on the 30,000' view, lets start honing in on the specific areas at a 10,000' view and lower.  
One of the defining factors between the 30,000' and 10,000' views is **when** the process is carried out. The 30,000' should be carried out up front and possibly at intervals during product development.  
The 10,000' view should be carried out each Sprint for each PBI as it's pulled into WIP.
